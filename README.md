# FYP-Development
Github Repository for Final Year Project Design code and implementation.
This application will allow a user to decide on a route between two points on a terrain system, using mapping and traversal techniques to find the optimal path between them.

# NOTE: Only work on this on the laptop.
I don't have the patience to keep editing files for setting which directory does what, etc.

# NOTE: For environments, the Python directory is located in different places on Laptop and Desktop.
## Small annoyances:
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` - PS1 command to allow script to activate.
Also, pyenv.cfg needs to be edited with the correct path. Use the change_directory.sh script to do this between machines.

## To-Do List
- [ ] Add correct Github Link to Document, it is currently the old one.
- [ ] Apply Graph algorithms to 3d array, plot, etc.
- [ ] Design GUI for displaying data.
- [ ] Decide on Data structure, how to connect points on graph.
